a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

class Movie{
    constructor(title, studio, rating){
        this.title = title
        this.studio = studio
        this.rating = rating
    }
}

let m1 = new Movie("Leo", "7Screens", "PG18")
console.log(m1.title, m1.studio, m1.rating);

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

class Movie{
    constructor(title, studio, rating = "PG"){
        this.title = title
        this.studio = studio
        this.rating = rating
    }
}
let m1 = new Movie("Leo", "7Screens", "PG18")
let m2 = new Movie("Kanguva", "StudioGreen")
console.log(m1.title, m1.studio, m1.rating);
console.log(m2.title, m2.studio, m2.rating);

c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

class Movie{
    constructor(title, studio, rating = "PG"){
        this.title = title
        this.studio = studio
        this.rating = rating
    }

    static getPG(movies){
        let pgMovies = [];

        movies.forEach(function(movie){
            if(movie.rating === "PG"){
                pgMovies.push(movie)
            }
        });
        return pgMovies;
    }
}

let m1 = new Movie("Leo", "7Screens", "PG18")
let m2 = new Movie("Kanguva", "StudioGreen")
let m3 = new Movie("GOAT", "AGS", "PG20")
let m4 = new Movie("Vampire Diaries", "MKK Productions")
let m5 = new Movie("Originals", "Vampire D")
let m6 = new Movie("LUPIN", "French X", "PG15")

let movies = [m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6];

console.log(Movie.getPG(movies));

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

class Movie{
    constructor(title, studio, rating = "PG"){
        this.title = title
        this.studio = studio
        this.rating = rating
    }
}

let m1 = new Movie("Casino Royae", "Eon Productions", "PG12")
console.log(m1.title, m1.studio, m1.rating)
